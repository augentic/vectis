# Crux Code Reviewer

Systematically review a generated Crux application for structural issues,
logic bugs, and general code quality problems. Produces a severity-graded
report with actionable findings and suggested fixes.

This skill catches semantic issues that compilers, linters, and clippy miss:
missing `render()` calls, conflict-resolution gaps, pending-op coalescing bugs,
state machine incompleteness, and interaction-sequence race conditions.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target-dir` | **Yes** | Path to the Crux app directory to review (contains `shared/src/`) |
| `reference-dir` | No | Path to a known-good app for comparative review (e.g. `examples/todo`) |
| `scope` | No | `full` (default) runs all three passes; `quick` runs structural + quality only, skipping logic simulation |

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Read the following files from `{target-dir}`:

- `spec.md` -- the app specification (required for logic pass)
- `shared/Cargo.toml` -- dependencies and features
- All `.rs` files under `shared/src/` -- focus on `app.rs` (the `update()` function)

If `reference-dir` is provided, also read the corresponding files from the
reference app. Differences between the two highlight potential regressions.

### 2. Review-fix cycle (max 3 iterations)

Before starting, initialize:

- `iteration = 1`, `max_iterations = 3`
- An empty list of **accumulated design-level findings** (carried across
  iterations)

The cycle repeats: run review passes, report findings, auto-fix mechanical
issues, then re-review the fixes. The cycle exits when no mechanical fixes
are applied or `max_iterations` is reached.

#### 2a. Select passes for this iteration

**First iteration** (`iteration = 1`): Run all four passes -- structural,
logic, quality, and comparative. This is the comprehensive initial review.

**Subsequent iterations** (`iteration > 1`): Run only the **structural pass**
and **quality pass**, scoped to files modified by the previous iteration's
fixes. Skip the logic pass and comparative review -- mechanical fixes
(serde derives, `render().and()`, `.trim()` checks) do not alter event
sequences or conflict-resolution logic.

#### 2b. Structural pass

Read `references/crux-review-checks.md` in this skill's directory.

Apply checks CRX-001 through CRX-010 against the source code. These are
pattern-based checks that scan for known Crux-specific issues:

- Missing `render()` after state mutations
- Missing serde derives on bridge-crossing types
- Input validation gaps on user-supplied text
- Timestamp completeness on `PendingOp` variants
- ViewModel field typing (typed values vs pre-formatted strings)
- Unused dependencies in `Cargo.toml`

For each violation found, record: check ID, file, line range, description,
severity (Critical or Warning), and suggested fix.

#### 2c. Logic pass (first iteration only; skip if scope = quick)

Read `references/logic-review-checks.md` in this skill's directory.

Apply checks LOG-001 through LOG-008. These require reasoning about event
sequences, not just pattern matching. For each check:

1. **LOG-001 State machine completeness** -- Enumerate every state enum
   (Page, SyncStatus, SseConnectionState, etc.). For each transition in
   `update()`, verify that all required side-effects fire (render, save, sync).
   Draw the state machine mentally; flag incomplete edges.

2. **LOG-002 Operation coalescing** -- Trace the sequence: Create -> Delete
   before sync. Does the code skip the server call for items that were never
   synced? Check both `DeleteTodo` and `ClearCompleted` handlers.

3. **LOG-003 Concurrent operation conflicts** -- Trace: sync in-flight +
   SSE event for the same item. Does `pending_ops.retain()` in the SSE handler
   clobber the in-flight sync state?

4. **LOG-004 Temporal ordering** -- For every conflict-resolution comparison,
   verify both sides have timestamps. Check `PendingOp` variants for missing
   temporal fields.

5. **LOG-005 Fallback-on-None** -- For every `unwrap_or_default()`, `Option`
   with `_ => true`, or `None` fallback, check if the default is semantically
   correct in the domain.

6. **LOG-006 Rapid-action sequences** -- Trace what happens when the user
   fires the same action twice before the first async operation completes.
   Check for duplicate pending ops or unbounded queue growth.

7. **LOG-007 Spec gap detection** -- Compare each user-facing Event variant
   against the Features section of `spec.md`. Flag events that accept untrusted
   input without validation that common sense requires (empty strings, negative
   numbers, duplicate IDs) even if the spec is silent.

8. **LOG-008 Missing edge-case tests** -- Cross-reference the `#[cfg(test)]`
   module against the interaction sequences from LOG-001--007. Each identified
   risk should have at least one test.

Record findings with severity Critical (data loss, incorrect server calls) or
Warning (stale UI, missing tests).

#### 2d. Quality pass

Read `references/general-review-checks.md` in this skill's directory.

Apply checks GEN-001 through GEN-012 against all `.rs` files. These are
language-level quality checks:

- No `unwrap()`/`expect()` in production code (tests exempt)
- No debug output (`println!`, `dbg!`, `eprintln!`)
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Error propagation (not silent swallowing)
- Match arm exhaustiveness
- Serialization round-trip completeness
- Function length (under 50 lines)

Record findings with severity Warning or Info.

#### 2e. Comparative review (first iteration only; if reference-dir provided)

Compare structural decisions between the target and reference apps:

- Event variant signatures (do they carry timestamps/IDs from the shell?)
- PendingOp variant structure (do they carry enough data for conflict resolution?)
- ViewModel field types (typed vs pre-formatted)
- Test coverage breadth (count and categorize tests in both)

Flag significant divergences as Warning with a note explaining what the
reference app does differently and why.

#### 2f. Produce iteration report

Output the findings for this iteration. On the first iteration, use the
full report format. On subsequent iterations, report only new findings
discovered in re-review and note the iteration number.

```
## Code Review Report: {app-name} (iteration {N})

### Summary
- Critical: N findings
- Warning: N findings
- Info: N findings

### Critical Findings

#### [CRX-001] Missing render() after page transition
- **File**: shared/src/app.rs, lines 384-388
- **Issue**: Navigating from Error to Loading mutates `model.page` without
  emitting `render()`. The shell may not see the Loading state.
- **Fix**: Wrap the return in `render().and(Command::event(Event::Initialize))`

... (one block per finding, ordered by severity then file)

### Warning Findings
...

### Info Findings
...

### Test Gap Summary
- Missing test for: [scenario description]
- Missing test for: ...
```

Classify each finding as **mechanical** (auto-fixable) or **design-level**
(requires architectural decisions). Add design-level findings to the
accumulated list.

#### 2g. Auto-fix mechanical issues

Apply fixes for findings that are mechanical:

- Adding missing `Serialize`/`Deserialize` derives
- Wrapping returns in `render().and(...)`
- Adding `.trim()` and empty checks on text inputs
- Removing unused dependencies from `Cargo.toml`

Do NOT auto-fix logic bugs (LOG-001 through LOG-008) without explicit
confirmation -- these require design decisions.

After any fixes, re-run `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy` to
verify the fixes compile and pass.

#### 2h. Loop control

After applying fixes and verifying:

1. If **no mechanical fixes** were applied in this iteration, exit the cycle.
2. If `iteration >= max_iterations`, exit the cycle.
3. Otherwise, increment `iteration` and return to step 2a.

When the cycle exits, output a summary across all iterations:

```
### Review Cycle Summary
- Iteration 1: Fixed N mechanical issues (CRX-001 x3, CRX-002, CRX-005).
  M design-level findings deferred.
- Iteration 2: Fixed K regressions (GEN-005 from iteration 1 fix).
  No new design-level findings.
- Total: N+K mechanical fixes applied. M design-level findings accumulated.
```

### 3. Express accumulated design-level findings as an OpenSpec change

After the review-fix cycle completes, check whether any **design-level
findings** were accumulated -- findings that require architectural decisions,
data-type changes, event-signature modifications, or logic rewrites
(typically CRX-003, CRX-004, CRX-006, CRX-007, LOG-001 through LOG-008).
If none were accumulated across any iteration, skip this step.

If design-level findings exist, create a single OpenSpec change to track
all of them:

1. **Derive a change name** from the app name and append the current
   date-time for traceability:

   ```
   review-{app-name}-{YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM}
   ```

   Example: `review-opsx-todo-2026-03-11T14-30`

   Use the shell to get the current timestamp:
   ```bash
   date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M"
   ```

2. **Create the change directory**:
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```

3. **Generate artifacts using the openspec workflow**:

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to get the artifact
   build order. Then for each artifact in dependency order:

   a. Get instructions:
      ```bash
      openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
      ```
   b. Read any completed dependency artifacts for context.
   c. Create the artifact file using the template from instructions,
      populated with content derived from the accumulated review findings.
   d. Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete.

4. **Content guidelines for each artifact**:

   - **proposal.md**: The "Why" section summarizes the accumulated review
     findings by severity and risk. The "What Changes" section lists each
     design-level finding as a bullet. Note which mechanical fixes were
     already applied across all iterations and how many review cycles ran.
     The "Impact" section identifies affected files, shell contract changes,
     and migration concerns.

   - **design.md**: Each design-level finding becomes a Decision section
     with rationale and alternatives considered. Group related findings
     (e.g., all timestamp-related changes under one decision). Reference
     the specific check IDs (CRX-xxx, LOG-xxx) that motivated each decision.

   - **specs/**: Create one spec file per logical area (e.g., `sync-logic`,
     `input-validation`). Each requirement maps to a review finding.
     Scenarios should be derived from the simulation traces performed
     during the logic pass (LOG-001 through LOG-008). Use WHEN/THEN format.

   - **tasks.md**: Order tasks by dependency -- data-type changes first,
     then event signatures, then handler logic, then test updates, then
     new tests, then verification. Each task references the finding ID it
     addresses. Include a final verification section that re-runs the
     code-reviewer skill to confirm all Critical findings are resolved.

5. **Show final status**:
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

   Summarize: change name, location, artifacts created, and prompt
   the user with "Run `/opsx:apply` or ask me to implement to start
   working on the tasks."

## Severity Definitions

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Data loss, incorrect server calls, conflict-resolution failure, panic in production | Must fix before archive |
| **Warning** | Stale UI, missing tests, suboptimal types, unnecessary clones | Should fix; acceptable to defer with justification |
| **Info** | Style, documentation, minor improvements | Fix if convenient |

## Integration with OpenSpec Workflow

This skill is invoked as part of the `crux-app` schema's task list, after
code generation and compiler verification, before archive:

```
propose -> apply (core-writer) -> verify -> review-fix cycle (this skill, up to 3 iterations) -> generate change for design issues -> archive
```

The review-fix cycle auto-fixes mechanical issues and re-reviews its own
fixes, iterating until the code is clean or the iteration limit is reached.
Design-level findings from all iterations are accumulated into a single
OpenSpec change with all artifacts (proposal, design, specs, tasks) ready
for implementation. This makes the output of a review directly actionable --
the user can immediately run `/opsx:apply` to start fixing the issues.

The tasks artifact for a crux-app change includes a Code Review section that
invokes this skill. See the `crux-app` schema for details.

The skill can also be invoked standalone at any time:

> Use the code-reviewer skill to review `examples/my-app`

> Review `examples/my-app` against `examples/todo` as a reference
